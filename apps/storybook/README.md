# /apps/storybook

Storybook application for component development and visual documentation.

<!-- SYNC: When files in this directory change, update this document. -->

## How stories are organized

One shape, so a reader can guess where anything lives and the visual gate can
find it:

```
<Package>/<Component>/(Default | Theme Sheet | …)
<Package>/Hooks/<hook>
<Package>/Themes/<theme feature>
```

- **`<Package>`** is `Core`, `Lab`, `Charts`, `Vega` or `RichText` — the package
  the thing ships from, never a category like "Components".
- **`Default` comes first.** The simplest honest use, and the first thing a
  builder sees.
- **`Theme Sheet` comes second** — every themeable target of that component, in
  every variant and state its `.doc.mjs` declares, on one page. It is the
  reference for theme authors and the surface the visual gate photographs under
  the probe theme, which is how a theming target is proven to still reach the
  pixels. A component whose sheet is missing a target has a target nothing can
  verify.
- **Hooks and theme-level features are not components** and do not sit beside
  them. Icon and indicator registries, `MediaTheme`, `CodeTheme` and the like
  live under `Themes/`.

The **Core/Dialog/No reset CSS (#6678)** story reproduces the shipped Dialog
border in an isolated iframe with built `astryx.css` and neutral `theme.css`,
but no `reset.css` (which Storybook imports globally). Build core and
`@astryxdesign/theme-neutral` before viewing it; the normal Storybook Dialog
stories use source instead of the published CSS/JS pipeline.

### A Theme Sheet must not pin its own theme

Render the component plainly and let the toolbar drive the theme. A story that
wraps itself in `<Theme theme={…}>` overrides the global, so the toolbar cannot
switch it and the visual gate can never probe it — the story becomes invisible
to exactly the testing it looks like it is helping with.

```tsx
// Good — the toolbar (and the gate) control the theme
export const ThemeSheet: Story = {
  name: 'Theme Sheet',
  render: () => (
    <>
      {VARIANTS.map(v => (
        <Badge key={v} variant={v}>
          {v}
        </Badge>
      ))}
    </>
  ),
};
```
